# Assignment2 
This is the repo for ETC5513 Assignment 2 due on Wednesday  April 27 at 16:30pm (Melbourne time).

# The Goals of the assignment:

- Demonstrate that you are capable to create a reproducible report using Rstudio, Git and GitHub using all the tools that we 
have learnt.
- Confirm that you are able to clone a repository locally and synchronise the changes to the remote GitHub repo.
- Confirm that you can create meaningful commits so that the changes and the history of the project can be tracked.
- Show that you can create and merge branches as well as resolve conflicts.


# Tools:

In order to complete this assignment you will need to have R, Rstudio installed locally in your computer and you will need to 
have access to your GitHub account. You can also use GitKraken.

# Tasks:

The tasks for the assignment are as follows:

- Create a simple report that contains the following sections:
 Introduction to the research question and context (No more than 200 words.)
- Exploratory data analysis including two figures and two tables describing the data.
- All figures and tables in the report need to be explained and referenced in the text (in total no more than 200 words) 
- Conclusions (No more than 150 words).
- For the report you will need to:

   - Select a data set of your choice for this report (with no more than 5 variables and 1000 rows). If you need to process the data to reduce the size do it before you include the data in your repository. Inside the repo the data files need to be inside a folder called Data.
   - Make sure you commit changes with clear messages so that we can understand what you did in each commit.
   - Create two branches and work in them for few commits at different times. Merge them with the master branch. Make sure that at least one branch creates a conflict with your master branch. Create commits that show clearly that you merged the branches. In addition, make sure that you have a commit showing that you fixed at least one merging conflict. You are free when and where you create and merge the branches in your repo history.
   - Your repo would need to contain all the necessary files to produce the report and the report must knit into an html file.
 
 # Due date

- Assignment is due on Wednesday  April 27 at 4:30pm (Melbourne time). Late submissions will not be accepted.
- By the due date all the changes in your repo needs to be merged to the master branch.
- If GitHub repos are modified after the submission date. The assignment will be marked with a 0.
 
 # Assignment submission 

- In Moodle: paste the http of your GitHub repo.
- Upload the Rmd file of the project.
- Print your  html report into pdf using your preferred browser  and upload that pdf file into Moodle too (Google Chrome works quite well for that).
- Important:
    - Your GitHub repo including all the history will be also marked. 
    - Don’t worry if you encountered problems during the commits, branching or merging. The important thing is that all the conflicts are  resolved and you have your final report in the last commit of your master branch. That will show that you are capable to use the tools!
